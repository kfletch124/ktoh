Each file has a heterogeneous Boolean network with two totalistic rules such that a fraction Î¸ of the nodes obey one totalistic rule and the remaining nodes obey a second totalistic rule. In each network self-input for each node is assumed and k represents the number of other nodes in each neighborhood that are randomly selected from all other nodes in the network. All nodes are updated at each time step using one of two totalistic rules that are assigned initially and do not change during the evolution of the network. These two totalistic rules are chosen from sixty-four selected totalistic rules that turn a node ON or OFF when 0, 1, 2, 3, k, or k+1 nodes in its neighborhood are ON and turn OFF otherwise. Each file is labeled with the two rules that are used in the heterogeneous Boolean network where each number in the rule means that a node turns ON when that many nodes in the network are ON and OFF otherwise. For example, rule 023k+1 is the rule in which a node turns ON when 0, 2, 3, or k+1 nodes in its neighborhood are ON and OFF otherwise. The mean-field approximations for each network is used to create bifurcation diagrams for each network for each value of k from 4 to 20.  All codes used are included in the file.
For more details refer to the thesis paper for which these bifurcation diagrams were created here:
